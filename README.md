Event Tracker Project
---------------------

For our second General Assembly project, I have built an event scheduler app that allows users to sign in and create events stored in the API. They may subsequently add new events to their existing events, update their details and delete them.  The user may also change their password or sign-out, at which point they will no longer have access to any other function.

I approached this project starting with the backend, working through the steps we learned to build an API.  I tested it with curl scripts and then moved on to building the front end, starting with the functions that required connecting with the API and ultimately moving on to the styling at the end.

When I cam across problems, I tried to work through my code backward to find the issue and used console logs to understand how my code was behaving. If I wanted to find out how to do something, I found that google was usually able to direct me to the correct resource. I also sought the advice of my peers to see how they had handled these issues. When none of these methods produced a solution, I submitted an issue to my instructors.
